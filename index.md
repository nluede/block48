## Project idea

The idea for this keyboard developed over quite some time. It all started with the desire to create a keyboard on my own without using all pre-manufactured parts. 
One thing is very important to me when it comes to keyboards: the board needs to have some weight. So my first thought was to make the keyboard out of concrete. Concrete is heavy, cheap and can easily be used in a diy manner. You find tons of diy concrete casting videos on YouTube. The idea was to cast a concrete keyboard. All the wiring can be sunk in the concrete. That's a big advantage because i find that most handwired keyboards look very messy.
